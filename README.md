# Tic Tac Toe

![Design preview for the Tic Tac Toe coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

The classic game of tic tac toe, built by matching the designs provided by [Frontend Mentor's coding exercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tic-tac-toe-game-Re7ZF_E2v). The game is played on a 3x3 grid - the first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

The app uses context and reducers for state management, styled components for styling, and localStorage for persistant game data.
